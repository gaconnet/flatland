class Form(Dict):
    """A declarative collection of named fields.

    Forms behave like :class:`flatland.Dict`, but are defined with Python
    class syntax:

    .. doctest::

      >>> from flatland import Form, String
      >>> class HelloForm(Form):
      ...     hello = String
      ...     world = String
      ...

    Fields are assigned names from the declaration.  If a named schema is
    used, a renamed copy will be assigned to the Form.

    .. doctest::

      >>> class HelloForm(Form):
      ...     hello = String.named('hello')   # redundant
      ...     world = String.named('goodbye') # will be renamed 'world'
      ...
      >>> form = HelloForm()
      >>> sorted(form.keys())
      [u'hello', u'world']

    Forms may embed other container fields and other forms:

    .. doctest::

      >>> from flatland import List
      >>> class BigForm(Form):
      ...     main_hello = HelloForm
      ...     alt_hello = List.of(String.named('alt_name'),
      ...                         HelloForm.named('alt_hello'))
      ...

    This would create a form with one ``HelloForm`` embedded as
    ``main_hello``, and a list of zero or more dicts, each containing an
    ``alt_name`` and another ``HelloForm`` named ``alt_hello``.

    Forms may inherit from other Forms or Dicts.  Field declared in a subclass
    will override those of a superclass.  Multiple inheritance is supported.

    The special behavior of ``Form`` is limited to class construction time
    only.  After construction, the ``Form`` acts exactly like a
    :class:`~flatland.Dict`.  In particular, fields declared in class
    attribute style do **not** remain class attributes.  They are removed from
    the class dictionary and placed in the
    :attr:`~flatland.Dict.field_schema`:

    .. doctest::

      >>> hasattr(HelloForm, 'hello')
      False
      >>> sorted([field.name for field in HelloForm.field_schema])
      [u'hello', u'world']

    The order of ``field_schema`` after construction is undefined.
